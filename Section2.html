                2.1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page 
            </h6><p1> 
                My homepage is esentially an about me, and this could be developed into something more interesting/sophisticated with 
                a better knowledge of graphic design, and contains the blue and yellow navbar with a vinyl background, opaqued in GIMP
                by overlaying a white layer, which is then made semi transparent to give the effect of opacity, as this property is not 
                available to edit in default HTML or CSS on an image. Underneath is a Trello link to the initial plans for pages which can be compared
                to more modern builds ofthe site to see how the graphical vision has developed.

                2.1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites 
            </h6><p1> 
                <ul>
                        <li> Many uses of images online may not fall under fair use as they are being
                        used to sell a monetised product; not in education, as criticism, parody or any other exception. 
                        Many, many things fall under intellectual property, which cannot be used without the users permission.</li>
                        <li>I will be aware of this when creating my website by avoiding watermarked or copyrighted images when selecting images.
                        Aspect ratios on different devices also make website developing far harder than they could be, as the graphics and I need
                        to accomodate for all screen sizes; landscape, portrait, laptop, phone, TV etc.<br>

            <h6>
                2.1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face
                when using web pages and how we can overcome them.
            </h6><p1> 
                People with colour impairments, this can be combated by having multiple versions of a website for people that are different sorts
                of colourblind. Dyslexia can also be accommodated with simple fonts such as Sans Serif and dyslexic friendly colour schemes.
                Deaf people can also be accommodated for by having subtitles on videos to accomodate for lack of hearing. You also need to be aware of
                overstimulation for those with Autism, ADHD or have Seizures, and combat the dangers of this by keeping the website simple and not overwhelming.

                2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites
            </h6><p1> 
                HTML is the standard for the actual website file(HyperText Markup Language),
                and GIF, PNG and JPEG are the common file used to complement this in images 
                gifs and videos. PNG is the most common file type on a website as this was 
                designed specifically for websites. Javascript and Perl are also commonly used 
                as scripts on a website to complement the HTML and CSS. I will be using HTML for the base,
                 CSS for style and Javascript for backend<br><br>
