                        <li> Many uses of images online may not fall under fair use as they are being
                        used to sell a monetised product; not in education, as criticism, parody or any other exception. 
                        Many, many things fall under intellectual property, which cannot be used without the users permission.</li>
                        <li>I will be aware of this when creating my website by avoiding watermarked or copyrighted images when selecting images.
                        Aspect ratios on different devices also make website developing far harder than they could be, as the graphics and I need
                        to accomodate for all screen sizes; landscape, portrait, laptop, phone, TV etc.<br>

            </h6><p1> 
                People with colour impairments, this can be combated by having multiple versions of a website for people that are different sorts
                of colourblind. Dyslexia can also be accommodated with simple fonts such as Sans Serif and dyslexic friendly colour schemes.
                Deaf people can also be accommodated for by having subtitles on videos to accomodate for lack of hearing.<br>

                2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites
            </h6><p1> 
                HTML is the standard for the actual website file(HyperText Markup Language),
                and GIF, PNG and JPEG are the common file used to complement this in images 
                gifs and videos. PNG is the most common file type on a website as this was 
                designed specifically for websites. Javascript and Perl are also commonly used 
                as scripts on a website to complement the HTML and CSS. I will be using HTML for the base,
                 CSS for style and Javascript for backend<br><br>
