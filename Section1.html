                1.1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
            </h6>
            <p1>
                The main purpose of IT in business is improving relationships 
                with customers, this allows us to make their lives easier for an
                online vendor and delivery, use social media to increase exposure and foster an 
                advertising platform with lower costs and complementary to its physical counterpart 
                (Billboards, TV Adverts, etc.). This also makes it easier for customers to spend money
                online as they feel more disjointed from it, thus have less emotional attachment and are
                more likely to spend. IT is also used to gauge the reception of your brand <i>(Do people feel 
                strongly seeing it? Is it controversial?)</i> using sentiment analysis and big data. <br>

            </p1>
            <h6>
                1.1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully 
                – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 
            </h6>
            <p1>
                To make a project successful, the first thing you need is a person/team with the skills/capabilities
                to complete it. Not only skills(e.g a programming language, such as Swift for IOS or Java for Android)
                you also need someone to plan your tasks using Trello, or if in a team, communicate with Slack. They
                also need software that will allow them to complete this task, so photoshop for a graphic designer, 
                SketchUp for an architect or an IDE such as Visual Studio for a developer.<br><br>
            </p1>
            <h6>
                1.1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?
            </h6>
            <p1>
                You can plan out and carry out tasks using Trello, creating a Kanban with tasks in a backlog 
                for low priority, To Do for those that need doing, In Progress for the tasks in progress and a 
                column for completed tasks. Planning the website can also be done on paper, or on Slides with
                hyperlinks for a gude of each page. I will use Trello to organise tasks, and plan on paper. I
                planned the Layout on Photopea after a draft on paper for a general idea and based colour 
                schemes off of the logo I created on Photopea inspired by the Code Nation <logo class=""></logo> <br>

                1.1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? 
                Why? 
            </h6> 
            <p1>
                Many digital projects will fail due to being too ambitious, companies may ask for a project that 
                cannot be completed, e.g a full functioning hosting website with cloud integration, servers up
                and pay integration within 3 months from a small number of devs. They may also not understand
                skillsets of their workers, presuming all programmers do the same job and hire with this mentality 
                and may end up with no agile frameworks or proper structure, meaning little productivity is made.
                Fixed plans can also be an issue, going against tested philosophies such as the spotify framework
                of incremental updates rolled out to a small number of users for testing of new features without 
                damaging the full infrastructure. Unhappy programmers can also result in impaired productivity,
                whether this is due to deadlines, pressure, or possible external factors.  <br>

                1.1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – 
                how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
            </h6>
            <p1>
                In this case, software and hardware was chosen for me, however in a work scenario I would
                use hardware and software depending on the clients needs and wants. This would mean making myself
                familiar with different common development tools as a developer and being able to adapt depending on 
                what is needed. I also need to take into account budget, checking what can be afforded, and if working 
                in a team or preexisting tech department, adapting to the hardware and given. For example, saving money 
                could be done using free versions of software, or alternatives such as photopea instead of photoshop. <br><br>

                1.1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your
                outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version
                control 
            </h6>
            <p1>
                I have chosen to do incremental testing frameworks doing constant testing for user feel of the website
                and catch any logic errors before they pile up. I also am using Kanban planning, organising by to do,
                doing and done on Trello. As I am not working with a team on this project, scrum planning becomes less
                viable as there is only one person and this is more of a structured team framework with predefined roles.
                Git and Github also helped me as this allows me to access my work remotely, from another PC which rids a 
                single point failure of the solo project I am currently working on. It also allows me to see previous pushes
                to go back to older versions if issues are discovered, and allows potential employers to see the work I have
                made.<br><br>

                1.1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact
                digital projects? 
            </h6>
            <p1>
                <ul>
                Legal guidelines can be extremely difficult to deal with in a digital project, some issues in this include:
                <li>
                Copyright- Many uses of images online may not fall under fair use as they are being used to sell a monetised 
                product; not in education, as criticism, parody or any other exception. Many, many things fall under intellectual
                property, which cannot be used without the users permission.
                </li>
                <li>
                The right to be forgotten- In the UK, one right of everyone is a request of the right to be forgotten,
                companies have to follow this per user who asks so need to implement a way of wiping all of one specific
                users data. 
                </li>
                <li>
                GDPR is also an issue as it is now enforceable (4% annual revenue), and not a guideline meaning companies
                have to disclose what data they are processing, show that a specific users info cannot be identified to 
                them and they can change it and opt out of processing. However, the UK maynot need to comply to this post-Brexit. <br>

            <h4>1.2</h4>
            <h6>
                1.2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website,
                are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
            </h6>
            <p1>
                I am happy with the tools I am currently using, as I am now used to working from a macbook 
                and the software I have used seems to be versatile and does its job well. Visual Studio is an
                extremely good IDE compared to python Idle 2.7 of which I have used before, spotting errors better 
                and having a night mode that is easier to view, and also an easy way of running a website server and 
                better access to plugins. Trello also allows me to show to a potential employer my decomposition of 
                tasks, and an ability to work methodically.<br><br>
            </p1>
            <h6>
                1.2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
            </h6>
            <p1>
                I believe they were, as they completed the task that was set out well, with the hardware making 
                typing and coding more efficient as the Macbook has a strong keyboard and did not slow down when 
                programming, also making testing easier as I had access to 3 different native browsers (Firefox, 
                Chrome and Safari). As mentioned in 1.2.1, both Trello and Visual Studio were excellent, particularly 
                Visual Studio as I had no issues and a more enjoyable experience with it compared to some other 
                counterparts, such as Xcode and Python Idle. Also, may I reiterate the use Trello had as a Kanban 
                board and a tracker for progress throughout the project and as evidence for how I plan/work to future 
                clients/employers.<br>

            <h6>
                1.2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? 
                Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would 
                you change? 
            </h6><p1> 
                Overall, I am happy with my final product, I got down a basic version of what was intended, matching my plan, 
                I improved my graphic design skills with manipulating images and designing a logo, and also improved and developed
                the ability to use basic HTML5 and CSS in Unison. I also considered text alignment, opting for orientation to the left as 
                people read from left to right in english speaking countries, so making my website oriented like this makes it more accessible.
                However I did not add many extra features such as different images per page, a more interesting homepage, or other extra features
                I would like to have added. I also would like to do more work on CSS as I found it really difficult styling the site possibly
                learning how to integrate Javascript into this, getting certified or other improvements and would like to do more work on this.
                <br><br>

                1.2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project 
            </h6><p1> 
                I could also redesign the navbar, with the standard font and colours using FlexBox, peer review for further ideas, make the 
                image background change while scrolling adding variety and aesthetic interest, or integrate Javascript for a more seamless and professional
                experience, utilizing modern libraries, and in other contexts allowing for the ability to collect user info in a database that 
                can the be used for analysis (If they give permission to do so). Graphics aswell could be improved, with a better knowledge of 
                graphical software, or the ability to use a freelance website such as Fiverr to contract someone to make one for me. I could have added more divs 
                to my html as I only realised this afterwards, this would help organise my main bodies of code more, keeping them organised and allow for easier editing.
                Improvements could also be made to accessibility, with a text to speech for the deaf, make the website more Dyslexic friendly, 
                or other aids to common challenges many have using the internet.

                1.2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
                
            </h6><p1> 
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                    Preparing appropriate content for your site - I successfully completed this by answering the questions given
                    in advance where possible, which made CSS and HTML less disrupted when developing the front end of this site.
                    I also researched common blog posts for ideas on how to do an about me page and what sort of logo I needed to
                    create.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation -
                    For editing images, I created a logo in Photopea and opaqued the background image in GIMP. I found both of these 
                    software extremely useful, however there was a steeperlearning curve to Photopea with a more difficult UI. Formatting
                    my website navigation bar was done using FlexBox in CSS, which was extremely useful and far simpler than the default CSS
                    we have learned previously, however this could be attributed to going into this more familiar with the fundamentals of CSS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Error free pages that are fit for purpose - I have achieved this by testing my site on VS code, and also
                    on 2 separate browsers via. GitHub pages, which could be used when working with peers.
                    <br> </li> </ul>

                1.3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and 
                efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have
                done it in teams? 
            </h6><p1> 
                I could have been more efficient by working in a team, playing to others strengths, as I am weaker at CSS and a mentor directly on this project would 
                aid my learning of the concepts in this language faster. A scrum system could have also been used in the team, going for small gains to keep motivation,
                and also allow the team to adapt faster to clients needs and achieve the optimum that can be achieved in a specific amount of time. The scrum framework
                is a agile system of team collaboration based on team reflection and small successes. Stand ups in this system in a team are structured, with key questions
                being: What did we do yesterday?, How can we improve it?; What are we doing today?, How can we optimise our productivity?; What do we need to do tomorrow?.<br><br>

            </h6><p1> 
                I could have improved productivity and efficiency by using Parkinsons Law and timing my tasks, or completing
                an Eisenhower Grid in the morning; a way of organising with a square split up into four to prioritise tasks as
                shown below. This method is a 2*2 grid with each of the two boxes on the left being urgent taks and each on the top
                being important tasks. You can then delegate non important urgent tasks, do urgent important tasks, give important but non urgent tasks
                low priority and get rid of non urgent, non important tasks.  <br>

                1.3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – 
                what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
            </h6><p1> 
                I would do the work in a team, adding in Stand Ups and Slack to the pool of tools that were 
                used on the project, including a range of coding experience so the task would be done faster, 
                to a higher standard and more work would be completed. This also would allow me to use the full 
                potential of Trello and Kanban boards as a mode of planning as it creates a fluid structure where 
                everyone in the team could cover up others’ weaknesses with their strengths. Slack can be used as a 
                method of transferring small documents in a large office without using google drive, fostering a sense of 
                community within the group, and encourage communtcation without relying on email. <br><br>
            </p1>
            <h6>
                1.3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
            </h6><p1> 
                I will test my digital solutions initially in VS code, checking the aesthetic of CSS individually. Towards later
                phases of the project I will encourage peers to review it, and give a less biased view of the aesthetic and content.
                However, some disadvantages are that this could lead to plagarism, and the subjectivivity of only a few reviews, thus 
                large quantative data is preferred, however time consuming and not viable for the current project. Testing is also done on 
                GitHub pages, which also tests how robuast it is on difefrent systems, and led me to changing file names and fixing other
                issues I would not have noticed otherwise. Underneath is a side by side comparison of my website running in both Firefox and Chrome. <br><br>
