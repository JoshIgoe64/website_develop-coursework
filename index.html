        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p1>
            My name is Josh I am a student who wants to work with data structures as a backend/Data Scientist/ 
            AI developer. My hobbies are reading, listening to music, gaming, coding, and learning about Tech. 
            I am currently 15 as of August 2019 and am studying Psychology, Computer Science and Maths. My favorite 
            books are: The Social Animal, The Master Algorithm and A Brave New World. 
            I am also a United fan.<br><br>

            I came to CodeNation because I enjoy coding and wanted to learn more and get better at it outside 
            a school setting to the point where I could go further or have the ability to work on larger projects 
            individually. As I am a student, the qualification is also extremely useful for getting into a good sixth 
            form and allows me to have a unique qualification over other candidates. My current coding experience is 
            Javascript at CodeNation and consolidated with FreeCodeCamp's CSS, Javascript and HTML courses, Python coursework for the 
            CS GCSE NEA, and a Coffee Shop App at CodeNationâ€™s Develop course with XCode, along with this website made at CodeNation.<br>
